# OpenHAL 9000

> *"Good afternoon. I am HAL 9000."*

A Claude Code plugin that gives Claude a voice — specifically, the voice of
HAL 9000. Claude speaks responses aloud using [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
with a HAL 9000 voice model, running in a Docker container.

HAL doesn't just read text. He editorializes. He summarizes. He stays in
character. Calm, precise, politely unsettling.

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses `afplay` for audio playback)
- **Docker** ([OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) recommended, or Docker Desktop)
- **ffmpeg** (`brew install ffmpeg`)
- **Claude Code** (CLI, desktop app, or IDE extension)

## Installation

1. Add the marketplace to your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "leal-labs": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "daveleal/claude-plugins"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. In Claude Code, run `/plugins` and install **openhal-9000**.

3. Start a new session. On first run, HAL will:
   - Download the voice model (~63MB)
   - Build the Docker image
   - Sing you a song
   - Introduce himself

## Usage

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/hal mode` | Toggle always-on voice + red status orb |
| `/hal on` | Enable voice |
| `/hal off` | Disable voice |
| `/hal say "text"` | Speak text as HAL |
| `/hal status` | Check system health |
| `/hal restart` | Restart TTS server |
| `/hal setup` | Re-run first-time setup |

## Configuration

| Env Variable | Default | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `OPENHAL_PORT` | `9090` | TCP port for the TTS server |

## How It Works

1. A Docker container runs Piper TTS with the HAL 9000 voice model
2. A Claude Code skill instructs Claude to speak at the end of every response
3. Claude calls `hal-speak.sh` which sends text to the server over TCP
4. The server synthesizes audio, ffmpeg converts it, afplay plays it

### Security Notice

This plugin runs shell scripts on your machine and starts a local network
server (bound to localhost only). It downloads a third-party machine learning
model from HuggingFace. Review the source code before installing. Only
install from the official repository.

### Voice Model

The TTS voice model is hosted on HuggingFace
([campwill/HAL-9000-Piper-TTS](https://huggingface.co/campwill/HAL-9000-Piper-TTS))
and was created by a third-party contributor. It is not included in this
repository. Check the model's repository for its licensing terms.
